{% if customer_type == 'Individual' %}Premium Perma User {{ customer_pk }}{% else %}{{ customer_type }} {{ customer_pk }}{% endif %} has submitted a request to cancel their paid
subscription to Perma.cc.

At your earliest convenience, please log in to the "Recurring Billing"
section of the CyberSource Business Center (part of the "Virtual Terminal")
and cancel the subscription associated with Merchant Reference Number "{{ merchant_reference_number }}":
{{ search_url }}

- Under the "Manage Subscriptions" heading, look for a row of filters
- Click the last filter, which should read "Scope: All Subscriptions".
  A menu will appear. Scroll to the bottom and select "Field and Value",
  and then "Order/Merchant Reference Number." The button you initially clicked,
  "Scope: All Subscriptions", will be replaced by a text field, prompting
  you to enter a merchant reference number. Enter {{ merchant_reference_number }}
  and press return. A single subscription should now be visible.
- Click the hyperlinked "Subscription ID". The "Subscription Information"
  page should now be visible.
- To the far right of the page heading, "Subscription Details:",
  look for a series of icons. One is a credit card with a diagonal line
  through it. If you hover on that icon, a tool-tip appears that reads
  "Cancel Subscription". Click that, and then click "Confirm".
  DO NOT click the trash can with the tool-tip that reads "Delete Subscription".

The customer will continue to be charged until this task is completed.

No automatically generated emails will be sent to the customer by
CyberSource, Perma.cc, or Perma Payments. If you wish to email the customer
to tell them their cancellation has been processed, you may find their
contact information at Perma.cc
